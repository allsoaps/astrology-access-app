Quick Orb Verification
To verify the orb calculations are working correctly, check one aspect in your tblChartAspects table:

Find any aspect record (pick one with a small ExactDegree, like 2.5°)
Look up the two planets (Body1ID and Body2ID) in tblChartPositions
Manually calculate: |Planet1_Longitude - Planet2_Longitude|
Check: Does this difference approximately match the aspect angle ± ExactDegree?

Example:

If Sun=45° and Moon=135°, difference = 90° = Square aspect ✓
If ExactDegree=2.5°, then it's 2.5° away from a perfect square ✓
