# Project Review Summary - June 29th, 2025

## Critical Scope Clarifications

### Data Migration
- **ONLY** migrated Student data to tblPeople and tblLocation tables
- No other data migration will occur
- All business logic is new implementation

### Session Management
- **SCOPE CHANGE**: Originally multiple sessions per Student/Event/Date, now simplified to single session (SessionNumber=1) per Student/Event combination
- Sessions can be created without impressions initially (user can return later)

### Terminology
- **"Students" changed to "Viewers"** mid-project - use "Viewers" consistently going forward

### Cancelled Requirements
- **Moon phase calculations** - cancelled, no longer needed

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Core data management (Viewers, Events, Sessions, Impressions)  
- Swiss Ephemeris integration with chart generation (Natal, Event, Session)
- LocationIQ API integration across all workflows
- 18√ó18 aspect grid visualization with professional formatting
- Basic form workflows with user feedback and validation
- Deployment tested on clean machine

### üîÑ PARTIALLY COMPLETE  
- **Chart Visualization**: Grid complete, wheel charts still needed
- **Transit Charts**: Currently implemented but needs modification for:
  - "NATAL √ó Session" comparisons 
  - "EVENT √ó Session" comparisons
- **Data Deletion**: Inconsistent soft delete implementation

### ‚ùå MISSING FEATURES
- Multi-viewer analysis for comparing responses to same event
- Simple built-in reports for research analysis  
- Wheel-style chart displays
- Consistent soft delete pattern across all entities

## Technical Architecture Notes

### External Dependencies
- **LocationIQ API**: Critical path - needs graceful error handling as no manual coordinate entry fallback
- **Swiss Ephemeris**: Local files, includes connectivity test button in frmEphemerisConfig
- **No other internet dependencies**

### Performance Considerations
- Single user application - no concurrency concerns
- Chart generation is manual (button-click) per user workflow
- Bulk operations could cause performance issues - user works one item at a time

### Deployment
- Automated installer will create required folder structure
- Swiss Ephemeris files readily available from GitHub if corrupted

## User Profile & Constraints

### User Characteristics
- **Tech-phobic** - requires simple, built-in tools rather than exports/complex interfaces
- Uses message boxes and multi-entry point workflows for guidance
- Has existing backup habits from old system

### Handoff Constraints
- **No formal documentation** will be provided per user request
- **30-day warranty period** after delivery
- **In-code comments only** for next developer assistance
- User expects to "tell new developer what they want" 

### Delivery Scope
- Working .accdb file with implemented functionality
- Swiss Ephemeris installer
- Critical fixes during 30-day warranty period

## Quality Assurance Status

### Validated
- Date/time input validation
- Coordinate range validation  
- Special character handling
- Deployment on clean machine
- End-to-end workflow testing (with minor issues identified)

### QA Gaps
- Long text field validation not implemented
- Inconsistent "lose changes" warnings across forms
- Missing Cancel buttons on some forms

## Critical Technical Risks

### Highest Risk: Technical Complexity
- Swiss Ephemeris integration complexity
- API dependencies and error handling
- Database relationships and chart calculation logic
- No formal handoff documentation for next developer

### Mitigation Strategy
- Comprehensive in-code comments
- 30-day warranty support period
- Well-documented troubleshooting guides in project

## Immediate Development Priorities

1. **Transit Chart Modifications** - Support NATAL√óSession and EVENT√óSession comparisons
2. **Complete Current Workflow** - Address critical fixes from end-to-end testing  
3. **LocationIQ Error Handling** - Ensure graceful degradation
4. **Consistent UI Patterns** - Cancel buttons and change warnings
5. **Future Features** - Wheel charts, multi-viewer analysis, simple reporting
